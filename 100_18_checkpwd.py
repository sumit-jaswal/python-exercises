# A website requires the users to input username and password to register. 
# Write a program to check the validity of password input by users.
# Following are the criteria for checking the password:
# 1. At least 1 letter between [a-z]
# 2. At least 1 number between [0-9]
# 1. At least 1 letter between [A-Z]
# 3. At least 1 character from [$#@]
# 4. Minimum length of transaction password: 6
# 5. Maximum length of transaction password: 12
# Your program should accept a sequence of comma separated passwords and will check them according to the above criteria. 
# Passwords that match the criteria are to be printed, each separated by a comma.

# Input  : ABd1234@1,a F1#,2w3E*,2We3345
# Output : ABd1234@1
